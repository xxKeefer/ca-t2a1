# *ACME Corporation is looking for devs with an understanding of Rails. The following set of questions relate to this RfQ-requirement.*---
---

### Q1 | Describe the architecture of a typical Rails application. (200-300)
Rails applications can be said to follow two architectural design patterns. These two design patterns are Monolithic application and MVC. A monolithic application as a oppose to a micro-services application is an app that is formed from one whole code base. It provides all of its functionality within itself. This differs form a micro-services style app where the app is formed by combining lots of little apps that work together to form a whole. While there is some debate on whether rails follows a true MVC pattern it is easy to say that it employs the principles of MVC heavily. MVC stands for Model, View, Controller; It is a pattern that splits up the large monolithic app into three related sub systems. The Model is responsible for manipulating the records within the applications database. This includes adding, editing or updating and removing them. The View takes information retrieved from the the model and renders it into a human accessible display. In rails this mainly takes the form of rendering the various web pages that are requested by a user. Finally the Controller is responsible for orchestrating the communication between the Model and the View. It is also the interface for the user. The user will request information, the Controller receives that request in the form of a route or HTTP request and then requests the information required from the model send it to the view to be rendered and then returns it to the user.
